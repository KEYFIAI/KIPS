## Simple Summary
In order to push forward on our decentralization roadmap, we propose to distribute the 5.3m KEYFI community wallet into a series of allocations in preparation for the KeyFi DAO launch.  It is also in the best interests of the project to spread out the large balance of this wallet in order to provide reassurance to new holders.

## Abstract
If the proposal passes, we will follow the methods defined in the specifications for the transfer and burning of KEYFI tokens.

## Motivation
The current 5.3m token balance has been earmarked for community distribution since the token launch on Dec 9th, 2020.  In order to follow the decentralization roadmap, we propose a distribution for this wallet to achieve multiple objectives including:
* Funding the KeyFi DAO contract
* Funding the current KEYFI rewards pool contracts
* Funding Bridge Liquidity pools
* Rewarding all early adopter KEYFI stakers who have been staking in our first year
* Funding development and marketing incentives
* Burning 10% of the token supply to increase scarcity

## Specification

### Overview
The proposed allocations for the 5.3m KEYFI are as followes:

Bridge Liquidity
* 500,000 KEYFI for BSC Bridge
* 500,000 KEYFI for Polygon Bridge
* An additional 500,000 KEYFI on the BSC side and Polygon side will also be added to Bridge liquidity.  The remainder will be used for the staking rewards pool.

KeyFi DAO Treasury
* 1,000,000 KEYFI tokens to be transferred to the DAO contract
* The DAO contract functions the same as Compound's GovernorAlpha and the voting functionality is already hardcoded into the KEYFI token contract.

KEYFI Staking Airdrop
* 1,000,000 KEYFI tokens to be proportionally claimable by all KEYFI staking holders prior to snapshot.
* Snapshot will take place on December 9th 2022, the 1 year anniversary of the KeyFi Project.

Maintain current KEYFI rewards pool (Ethereum)
* 1,000,000 KEYFI tokens to fund the staking rewards for another year
* This will include a reduction of the staking rewards rate to ensure it will continue for another year.

Burn KEYFI tokens
* 1,000,000 KEYFI tokens to be burned, reducing the total supply to approximately 8.9m KEYFI tokens.

Transfer KEYFI tokens to dev / marketing pool
* 300,000 KEYFI tokens to be transfered to the dev wallet to be used for development incentives and marketing.

### Rationale
The proposal will distribute the 5.3m community wallet, leading to a more distributed and decentralized project as well as ensure the functionality of other parts of the project including bridges and rewards.  

### Technical Specification
After a successful vote result, the team will manually execute the transactions required to follow the processes outlined above.  The entire process will be completed around the 9th of December, 2021.  

### Test Cases
There are no test cases for this proposal.

### Configurable Values
The values will follow what is defined in the specifications.
