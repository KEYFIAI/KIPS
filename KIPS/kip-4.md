## Simple Summary
We are proposing to merge our two platforms, KeyFi Core and KeyFi Pro in order to improve our user experience, product clarity, onboarding, and technical development.

## Abstract
If the proposal passes, both versions of the app will be merged into one, hereby known as simply “KeyFi” app.

Premium features such as Research, Watchlist, Strategies, AI Analysis, News, Alerts, Actions, and Market Analysis will be visible to all users, but only members who have staked sufficient KEYFI will be able to interact with these tools.

## Motivation
KeyFi Core originated as our MVP that allowed the KeyFi and SelfKey communities to stake their assets. KeyFi Core also included basic transaction and tracking capabilities. The release of KeyFi Pro in December 2021—currently in private beta and soon to be in public beta—has made KeyFi Core mostly redundant.

Merging the two will yield several benefits, including development, operational, and user experience improvements.

If the proposal passes, we will be introducing a “freemium” model. As a result, we will showcase the Pro version’s front end design and premium features to all users.

## Specification

### Overview
We will implement the following:
* The KeyFi Core and KeyFi Pro versions of the app will be merged into one
* The features which are currently available in Pro only (Research, Watchlist, Strategy, AI Analysis, News, Alerts, Actions and Market Analysis) will become visible to free users of the app, but they will need to stake KEYFI or subscribe in order to gain access to those features
* Free users will have a more easy to use and appealing app

### Rationale
The majority of development work has been focused on the Pro version of the app. By merging both apps, free users will have a more appealing experience on KeyFi. Additionally, the advanced premium features available on Keyfi Pro, will be showcased and promoted to all free users. This will lead to increased usage of those features as free users become more engaged with the app and more likely to stake KEYFI or subscribe to the premium version.

### Technical Specification
After a successful vote result, the team will begin the process of refactoring the codebase and upating marketing materials and other official information to reflect the changes.

### Test Cases
There are no test cases for this proposal.

### Configurable Values
The values will follow what is defined in the specifications.
